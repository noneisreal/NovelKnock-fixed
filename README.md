# Fixed "NovelKnock" Dotfiles (Hyprland Edition)

A repaired & repurposed version of [end-4's](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland) dotfiles, 
with minor (and major) tweaks to actually boot and behave nicely.

Tested on EndeavourOS with Hyprland.

## Why?

Because the original configs look gorgeous but are half-broken, and I'm a fan of both aesthetics and sanity.
So I fixed the NovelKnock. (or i wanted to do something in this summer)

## Features

- Fixed paths for Hyprland updated 
- Added compatibility with non-end-4 users (aka humans)
- Disable nsfw art
- Support playing music on google chrome by extension Plasma Integation
- Not working fluently


## Credits

- Huge thanks to `end-4` for the original inspiration and visual magic.
- And thanks to [`soramanew`](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/shell) for the quickshell, it helps me a lot about appear notifications
- Praise be to Jesus for the strength to fix it
>[!TIP]
> - If media thumbnail or medata is missing, try all this option
>    - Use the bottom `reload hyprland config and eww` in side left
>    - Reload your tab play music 
>    - if the problem still, make a issue to report
> - Currently, Rofi is used as a launcher. 
> - EWW's built-in launcher does not support icons properly 
> - It's recommend play music by app outside 
> - If still want play on browser, recommend zen-browser, firefox, or firefox-based 
> - Not recommend chrome without extension Plasma Integation unless you want the eww show the thumbnail and artist etc 
> - screen lock function still not fixed yet - this function will be fixed in the future 
> - And if eww sometimes lag, please using shotcuts `Ctrl + Super + R` to all pkill and reload again

>[!NOTE]
> And about the folder "projects" folder in repo, that is from end-4, but also not working so i used other solution to appear notifications, you shouldn't use or compile it
